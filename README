If you want to generate a signed bundle so it can be uploaded to the OSS
Sonatype repository, you will need to run:

mvn clean package source:jar gpg:sign repository:bundle-create

You will need to enter the passphrase for your private GPG key at some point.
Please do not forget to distribute it to hkp://pgp.mit.edu if the signed
bundle is to be accepted in Maven Central!
